## Site Brief: ludomancien.com

### Mission & Positioning
**A French-language theory blog for tabletop RPG analysis and GM craft.** Ludomancien is an author-driven publication offering deep, analytical essays on game mastering, RPG design theory, and the craft of play. Think "long-form games criticism meets practical GM wisdom"—intellectual depth with real-table applicability.

### The Name
"Ludomancien" = *ludus* (play/game) + *-mancien* (practitioner of an art, like "nécromancien"). Suggests someone who practices the "dark arts" of gaming—both playful and slightly esoteric.

### Target Audience
- Experienced francophone GMs seeking to deepen their practice
- Theory-curious players interested in "why games work"
- RPG designers and content creators
- Readers who enjoy *The Alexandrian*, *Bastionland*, or *La Cellule* podcast
- **Not beginners** — assumes baseline RPG literacy

### Content Type
Long-form essays (1,500-3,000 words typically), published infrequently but with substance. Quality over quantity.

**Typical article topics:**
- Critique of popular GMing frameworks
- Analysis of specific game mechanics and their implications
- Contrarian takes on accepted wisdom
- Practical techniques grounded in theory

**Example recent article:** *"Pourquoi les typologies de joueurs sont presque inutiles"* — a critical examination of player taxonomy models (Robin's Laws, etc.)

### Voice & Tone
| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Analytical** | Arguments built on evidence and reasoning, not just opinion |
| **Opinionated** | Takes positions, not afraid to disagree with consensus |
| **Accessible erudition** | References theory without being academic or jargon-heavy |
| **Francophone authenticity** | Writes *in* French, not translated-from-English |
| **Dry wit** | Occasional sardonic humor, never forced |

### Current Brand Direction
- **No strong visual identity yet** — opportunity to establish one
- **Implicit aesthetic:** Thoughtful, slightly austere, intellectual but not pretentious
- The name evokes something between scholar and sorcerer

### Key Design Considerations

1. **Long-form reading experience** — typography and spacing for 10-15 minute reads
2. **Author credibility** — should feel like a curated publication, not a generic blog template
3. **Archival browsing** — easy to explore back catalog by theme
4. **Pull quotes / key insights** — highlight memorable passages for sharing
5. **Minimal distraction** — no sidebars full of widgets, no pop-ups
6. **Dark mode friendly** — audience likely reads at night

### What It's NOT
- Not a news/reviews site
- Not a tutorial site for beginners
- Not an aggregator or link blog
- Not a community platform
- Not a product/monetization vehicle (yet)

### Relationship to Other Properties
| Site | Role |
|------|------|
| **ludomancien.com** | Opinion, analysis, essays (this brief) |
| **jeuxderole.org** | Reference, definitions, resources (neutral) |
| **Fantasy Vixens** | Mature TTRPG content (separate brand) |

Ludomancien is the *voice*; jeuxderole.org is the *reference shelf*.

### Comparable Sites (for inspiration)

**Content peers:**
- [The Alexandrian](https://thealexandrian.net/) — theory + practical (but visually dated)
- [Bastionland](https://www.bastionland.com/) — designer voice, clean aesthetic
- [Goblin Punch](https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/) — distinctive voice (but Blogger limitations)

**Design inspiration (non-RPG):**
- [Craig Mod](https://craigmod.com/) — author-driven long-form, beautiful typography
- [Stratechery](https://stratechery.com/) — analytical essays, clean reading experience
- [Ribbonfarm](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/) — intellectual blog with personality

### Visual Identity Questions

1. **Aesthetic direction:**
   - Minimalist modernist? (Craig Mod style)
   - Subtle occult/esoteric touches? (matching "mancien" etymology)
   - Warm academic? (library/study feel)

2. **Typography priority:**
   - Serif for body text? (traditional essay feel)
   - How to handle bilingual terminology (French text, English game terms)?

3. **Color palette:**
   - Dark/muted tones? (matches intellectual, slightly gothic sensibility)
   - Accent color for highlights and links?

4. **Illustration approach:**
   - None (pure text)?
   - Occasional diagrams for concepts?
   - Header images per article?

### Technical Notes
- Low traffic, so performance less critical than aesthetics
- RSS feed important for theory-blog audience
- Consider reading time estimates on articles
- Footnotes/sidenotes capability valuable for this content type
